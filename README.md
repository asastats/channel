# ASA Stats Channel

An issue for every bug report and a feature request should be created in the [issues](https://github.com/asastats/channel/issues).

Every [ASA Stats discussion](https://github.com/asastats/channel/wiki/Discussions) besides [DAO discussions](https://github.com/asastats/dao-discussion/discussions) should take place in [discussions](https://github.com/asastats/channel/discussions).

A collaborated work on the official ASA Stats documents should take place in the [wiki](https://github.com/asastats/channel/wiki).

There should be no offtopic and/or casual communication in the Channel, please use the ASA Stats Community channels for such a purpose: the ASA Stats [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Vjx7w7pAC7), [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/asastats/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/asastatscom).
